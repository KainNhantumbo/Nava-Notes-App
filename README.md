## Features
- This application can perform all CRUD operations to manipulate note.

- Restore function: you can restore a deleted note, since the a stored in trash.

- Delete all trash notes by one click.
## Known issues
- Switching between dark and light modes requires a page refresh.

- There a only two themes.

- sort by last or first modifification doesn't work, yet.

- You can't log into an cloud account to save notes, since the app is using localStorage. If you switch the browser you will not acess the notes. If the browser cache and storage are cleared, all application data and settings will be lost.
